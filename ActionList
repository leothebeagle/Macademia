#  Routes and controllers to build:

# --> topics get route and view page for index.html.erb <-- *
# In this route can include a flash message if not logged in.
# message says: "If you would like to start adding topics to programs login"
# The view will check to see if flash message is available.
# if it is then will link to login page.
# if the user is logged in then the message will change and so will the view.
